# idleBerserker
Some scripts to help automate idle berserker tasks

Daily.py runs the daily codes for update and idle, depends on a members file.

timeTracker.py will message discord users when their dimensional gates are up, which they can then react to which starts a new timer for that gate.

getMembers.py will connect to discord and search for people with particular roles and add them to the members file.  As long as their name on discord matches their in-game name it will work as intended.
